# Weather-App
A Weather App in Python using OpenWeather's API

How to run the program:
1. Open VSC
2. Get your API key from OpenWeather's API and create a .env file then add your API key under the variable "API_KEY"
   
Note: Run the program in debugger mode, not the standard python compilation. It will give a "Keyerror: 'weather'" if you run it normally.

I still don't understand why :(
